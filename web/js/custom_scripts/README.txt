.js and .php files placed in this directory will automatically be included in scripts loading init.js.

subfolders will be ignored (recursive file loading is not supported. you're free to create sub-folders, but they will not be invoked automatically.)

These custom files will perist across HestiaCP upgrades.

This directory is not meant for HestiaCP development, but meant for people wantng to customize their own HestiaCP control panel.

Warning: modifications to this README.txt may be lost during HestiaCP upgrades.
